ðŸŒ¿ Air Quality Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
![alt text](https://github.com/lintangkosesar/neural_network_qt/blob/main/rustqtnn.jpg?raw=true)
In this project, I built an ANN model to predict air quality categories ("Good", "Moderate", "Unhealthy") based on five input parameters: PM10, SOâ‚‚, CO, Oâ‚ƒ, and NOâ‚‚ This proejct built by rust programming and QT builder GUI.
This project is implemented in Rust because of its high performance, memory safety, easy integration with other systems, and excellent support for concurrency â€” making it ideal for fast and reliable machine learning applications.

1. Trained on a dataset of 4000 samples.
2. Architecture: 5 input neurons, 3 hidden layers (each with 10 neurons), and 3 output neurons.

4. Training settings: learning rate = 0.001, epochs = 1000.
5. Achieved accuracy: around 90-98%.

6. This project also includes a Qt GUI to easily train the model and predict dummy data interactively.

Feel free to explore the code and the GUI interface! ðŸš€
